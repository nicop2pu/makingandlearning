# Goals of this Course 
The goal of this course is for participants to use our framework to assist in the design and/or implementation of a makerspace or maker program that supports learning in a museum or library. The course can support people who are beginning the development of a new makerspace or maker program or improving upon one that is already up and running. 

# Intended Audience

This course is intended for museum and library professionals, or anybody who is designing a makerspace. We encourage participants to engage in the sessions with team members, from your own organization and/or with partner organizations. 

## Format

The course consists of a 30 minute reading and four two-hour sessions, each of which will take about two hours to work through. The course has been designed to be taken as a learning circle: a model of peer-facilitated learning that is designed to add face-to-face interaction and social accountability to the online course experience. After each session, participants are encouraged to share their work on the virtual forum: writing comments, sharing a photo, or uploading a video.  

The sessions in this course are:

 * Session Zero: Introducing the Framework (30 minute pre-reading)
 * Session One: Setting a Vision for Making
 * Session Two: Developing a Common Language
 * Session Three: People Power
 * Session Four: Designing to Support Learning
